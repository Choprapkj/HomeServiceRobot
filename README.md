# Summary

ROS move_base package is used to move the robot, which interfaces with the ROS Navigation stack. The gmapping package provides laser-based SLAM , as a ROS node called slam_gmapping. Using slam_gmapping, you can create a 2-D occupancy grid map from laser and pose data collected by a mobile robot. The Navigation stack uses Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for path search.
